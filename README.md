It is an actual gameboy color rom that can theoretically work on real hardware

## Theme - Scale

This year's theme was Scale. I looked up "things that scale" and came across pizza places. It seemed like a fun starting point after my initial idea of a lizard scaling down a building and playing with weighted cubes didn't work out.

## Build History

This project was built using gbstudio, using assets by many people credited in the game.
